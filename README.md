March 2025   

• Engineered a distributed computing platform that dynamically allocates resources across volunteer nodes using ML prediction models, achieving 92% accuracy in forecasting resource availability (CPU: 3.2%, RAM: 4.1% MAE).  
 
• Developed a fault-tolerant coordinator-client architecture with real-time monitoring dashboard visualizing node performance and workload distribution     

• Implemented an intelligent task scheduling algorithm that improved system throughput by 73% and reduced completion times by 40%.
